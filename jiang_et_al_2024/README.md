# Rapid protein evolution by few-shot learning with a protein language model
## Goal
The goal of this directory is to reproduce the few-shot learning with a protein language model created in [Rapid protein evolution by few-shot learning with a protein language model](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.17.604015)
## Background
- Jiang et al. 2024 utilized a previously published table containing single amino acid VEPs and DMS measurments used for benchmarking
  - [Using deep mutational scanning to benchmark variant effect predictors and identify disease mutations](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20199380)
  - VEP = variant effect predictors, DMS = deep mutational scanning
  - DMS experiments combine saturation mutagenesis of a protein of interest with a high‚Äêthroughput functional testing and deep sequencing
  - **Source.xlsx** is an excel file containing VEP measurements from 31 previously published DMS experiments for single amino acid subsitutions. This was used to benchmark 46 VEPs. Each tab is for a specific protein. Within each tab, rows are variants and columns are VEPs used.
