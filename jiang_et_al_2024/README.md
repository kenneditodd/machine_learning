## Goal
The goal of this project is to repeat creating the few-shot learning with a protein language model in the publication mentioned above.
## Step 1
Jiang et al. 2024 utilized previously published data from [Using deep mutational scanning to benchmark variant effect predictors and identify disease mutations](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20199380).
